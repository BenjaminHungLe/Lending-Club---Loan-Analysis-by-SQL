# LENDING CLUB - LOANS ANALYSIS BY SQL

## **Overview**
Lending Club is an innovative lending platform that lends money to people in need at an interest rate based on their credit history and other factors. This project focuses on analyzing key factors such as credit history, employment, income, and ratings to help investors enhance understanding of investment risks and make wiser decisions on loan investments.
The dataset comprises 19,908 rows and encompasses 56 features, resulting in over 1.15 million records spanning the years 2007 to 2011.


## **Technical Highlights**
For data cleaning, I utilized Excel and Power Query to assess and clean data, addressing issues like missing values and incorrect formats. SQL was mainly applied to execute precise corrections and drop unnecessary features to ensure a refined and reliable dataset.
In the analysis task, SQL was employed to pull and aggregate the dataset to extract essential information for analysis which was accomplished using subqueries, WITH clauses, and VIEWS. Window Functions was conducted for the further analysis to identify patterns and trends, yielding relevant insights.
